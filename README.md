# Pet-Adoption-Game
The Pet Adoption Game is a console-based application that simulates the experience of  adopting and taking care of a pet. Users can adopt a pet, feed it, play with it, and check its  status. The game tracks the pet's hunger and happiness levels, and it ends if these levels  drop to critical values.
